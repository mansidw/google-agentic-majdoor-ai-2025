## üöÄ The Problem
Despite living in a digital age, we still find ourselves juggling physical receipts, they fade, get lost, or pile up in drawers. Keeping track of expenses becomes a tedious, manual task. Even with digital receipts, there‚Äôs little insight unless we go digging. People miss out on the full potential of their purchase history, whether it's optimizing their spending or taking advantage of relevant offers.

## üí° Our Solution: Raseed
Raseed (from the Hindi word for ‚Äúreceipt‚Äù) is your smart assistant for managing purchases. It integrates with Google Wallet and acts as both a receipt organizer and a personal finance advisor.

Raseed is built on the Google Agentic Majdoor AI 2025 platform‚Äîa hackathon-ready, extensible system designed to:
- Extract user intent from natural language (e.g., "I want to eat pizza", "Book a ride")
- Fetch real credit card data (via a mock Fi MCP server)
- Find and return relevant offers from vendors (Swiggy, Zomato, Uber, etc.) using Gemini AI or mocked logic
- Analyze receipts and more, with a beautiful, modern frontend

Think of it as your co-pilot for spending: it automatically captures receipt data, categorizes purchases, and even recommends the best credit cards to use for future savings based on your patterns. Users can request offers in plain English, and the backend extracts the intent and returns relevant deals. The system securely fetches (mock) user credit card info for personalized offers, dynamically maps intent to vendors (food, ride, shopping, etc.), and uses Google Gemini API for realistic, up-to-date offer generation.

Whether you‚Äôre trying to stick to a budget, maximize cashback, or just avoid losing another grocery bill, Raseed has your back. The platform is easily extensible‚Äînew intents, vendors, or LLM integrations can be added with minimal effort.
